- browsercookie==0.8.1
- requests==2.32.3
- tinytag==2.1.0

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jbff/simple_auto_beatsage_script.git
   cd simple_auto_beatsage_script
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Simple Usage

Process all music files in a directory with default settings:

```bash
python main.py -i /path/to/music/folder
```

This will:
- Process all supported audio files in the specified directory
- Generate maps with Expert and ExpertPlus difficulties
- Include Standard mode
- Add DotBlocks and Obstacles as events
- Use the FitBeat environment
- Use the v2 model
- Save output zip files to the same input directory
- Generate automatic lighting events for enhanced visual experience

### Advanced Usage

Customize the behavior with command-line arguments:

```bash
python main.py -i /path/to/music/folder -o /path/to/output/folder -d Hard,Expert -m Standard -e DotBlocks -env DefaultEnvironment -t v2
```

## Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Short | Description | Default |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--input` | `-i` | Input folder containing music files (required) | / |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output folder for the generated maps | Same as input folder |
| `--difficulties` | `-d` | Comma-separated list of difficulties | Expert,ExpertPlus |
| `--modes` | `-m` | Comma-separated list of play modes | Standard |
| `--events` | `-e` | Comma-separated list of events | DotBlocks,Obstacles |
| `--environment` | `-env` | Environment for the generated maps | FitBeatEnvironment |
| `--model_tag` | `-t` | Model version to use | v2 |

### Available Environments

## Limitations

- File size limit: 32MB
- Song duration limit: 10 minutes
- These limits apply to non-Patreon supporters of Beat Sage

## How It Works

The script:
1. Scans the input directory for compatible audio files
2. For each file:
   - Extracts metadata (title, artist) from ID3 tags
   - Creates smart filenames based on metadata (Title - Artist)
   - Uploads the file to Beat Sage with your specified settings
   - Displays real-time progress with colorized indicators
   - Downloads the generated Beat Saber map
   - Automatically extracts the map to a named folder
   - Generates automatic lighting events for enhanced visuals
   - Cleans up temporary zip files
3. Provides clear visual feedback throughout the process with emojis and colors

## Enhanced User Interface

The script provides a rich terminal interface with:
- üéµ Colorized output (when supported by your terminal)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Real-time progress indicators
- ‚ú® Clear status messages
- üìÅ Smart file organization
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip detection for existing maps
- üí° Automatic lighting generation feedback
