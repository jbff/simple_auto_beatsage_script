## Usage
### Command Line Script

Process all music files in a directory with default settings:

```bash
python bsdl.py -i /path/to/music/folder
```

Process a single audio file:

```bash
python bsdl.py -i /path/to/song.mp3
```

Process YouTube videos from a text file:

```bash
python bsdl.py -i /path/to/urls.txt
```

### Command Line (Windows Executable)

```cmd
bsdl.exe C:\path\to\music\folder
```

```cmd
bsdl.exe C:\path\to\song.mp3
```

```cmd
bsdl.exe C:\path\to\urls.txt
```

### Drag and Drop (Windows)

1. Copy `config_bsdl.yaml` to the same directory as the executable.

2. Edit `config_bsdl.yaml` to specify options to use when dragging/dropping.

3. Drag and drop any of the following onto the executable:
   - A directory containing audio files
   - A single audio file
   - A text file containing YouTube URLs (one per line)

## Example urls.txt:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0
```

### Advanced Usage

Customize the behavior with command-line arguments (these override config.yaml settings):

```bash
python bsdl.py -i /path/to/input -o /path/to/output/folder -d hard,exp -m std,noarrows -e dots,bombs1 -env nice -t flow
```
